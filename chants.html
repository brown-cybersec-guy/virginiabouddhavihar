            <p>Thus have I heard:</p>
            <p>Once the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi at Jeta's Grove, in Anathapindika's monastery. Then, in the middle of the night, a certain deity, whose surpassing splendor illuminated the entire Jeta's Grove, came to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, the deity stood to one side and said:</p>
            <p>"Many gods and men have pondered on blessings,</p>
            <p>Desiring well-being. Tell me, what is the highest blessing?"</p>

            <p>"Not to associate with fools,</p>
            <p>To associate with the wise,</p>
            <p>And to honor those who are worthy of honor —</p>
            <p>This is the highest blessing.</p>
            <p>To reside in a suitable locality,</p>
            <p>To have done meritorious actions in the past,</p>
            <p>And to set oneself on the right course —</p>

            <p>A well-trained discipline, and well-spoken words —</p>
            <p>This is the highest blessing.</p>
            <p>To support mother and father,</p>
            <p>To cherish wife and children,</p>
            <p>And to have peaceful occupations —</p>
            <p>This is the highest blessing.</p>
            <p>Generosity, living in accord with the Dhamma,</p>
            <p>Supporting one’s relatives, and blameless actions —</p>
            <p>This is the highest blessing.</p>
            <p>Avoiding evil, refraining from intoxicants,</p>
            <p>And diligence in virtue and Dhamma —</p>
            <p>This is the highest blessing.</p>
            <p>Respect, humility, contentment, and gratitude,</p>
            <p>And timely listening to the Dhamma —</p>
            <p>This is the highest blessing.</p>
            <p>Patience, willingness to accept advice,</p>
            <p>Seeing monks and conversing on the Dhamma at proper times —</p>
            <p>This is the highest blessing.</p>
            <p>Austerity, living the holy life,</p>
            <p>Seeing the noble truths, and realizing Nibbana —</p>
            <p>This is the highest blessing.</p>
            <p>A mind unshaken by the ups and downs of life,</p>
            <p>A mind freed from sorrow, defilement, and fear —</p>
            <p>This is the highest blessing.</p>
            <p>Those who act in this way,</p>
            <p>Are undefeated wherever they go.</p>
            <p>They always live in happiness —</p>
            <p>This is their highest blessing."</p>
            <p>Thus spoke the Blessed One.</p>
            <p>The deity was delighted with the Blessed One’s words, and rejoiced in what was said.</p>
