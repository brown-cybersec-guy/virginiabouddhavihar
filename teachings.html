      <h2>Introduction to Theravada Buddhism</h2>
      <p>Theravada Buddhism, often referred to as the "Teaching of the Elders," is the oldest and most orthodox school of Buddhism. It draws from the original teachings of the Buddha, as preserved in the Pali Canon, a collection of scriptures written in the ancient Pali language. Theravada emphasizes personal insight and self-discipline as a path to enlightenment, following the example set by the Buddha himself.</p>
      <p>Theravada Buddhists believe that enlightenment (Nibbana) can be achieved by following the Noble Eightfold Path, which includes ethical conduct, mental discipline, and wisdom.</p>

      <h2>The Four Noble Truths</h2>
      <p>At the core of Theravada Buddhism are the Four Noble Truths, which outline the nature of human existence and provide a framework for understanding the path to enlightenment:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The First Noble Truth: The Truth of Suffering (Dukkha):</strong> Life is inherently filled with suffering, dissatisfaction, and impermanence.</li>
        <li><strong>The Second Noble Truth: The Cause of Suffering (Samudaya):</strong> Suffering arises due to craving (tanha) and attachment.</li>
        <li><strong>The Third Noble Truth: The Cessation of Suffering (Nirodha):</strong> Suffering can be ended by eliminating craving and attachment.</li>
        <li><strong>The Fourth Noble Truth: The Path to the Cessation of Suffering (Magga):</strong> The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to overcome suffering.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>


    
    <div class="section-title">
      <h2>The Noble Eightfold Path</h2>
      <p>The Noble Eightfold Path is the cornerstone of Buddhist practice in Theravada tradition. It is divided into three categories: wisdom, ethical conduct, and mental discipline.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wisdom (Paññā):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Right View (Sammā-Ditthi):</strong> Understanding the nature of reality, particularly the Four Noble Truths.</li>
            <li><strong>Right Intention (Sammā-Sankappa):</strong> Cultivating a mindset of non-harm, renunciation, and goodwill toward all beings.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Ethical Conduct (Sīla):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Right Speech (Sammā-Vācā):</strong> Speaking truthfully, kindly, and avoiding harmful or divisive speech.</li>
            <li><strong>Right Action (Sammā-Kammanta):</strong> Acting in ways that are morally upright, refraining from harmful actions like killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct.</li>
            <li><strong>Right Livelihood (Sammā-Ājīva):</strong> Earning a living in a way that does not harm others or oneself.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Mental Discipline (Samādhi):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Right Effort (Sammā-Vāyāma):</strong> Diligently cultivating wholesome mental states and abandoning unwholesome ones.</li>
            <li><strong>Right Mindfulness (Sammā-Sati):</strong> Developing awareness of the body, feelings, mind, and mental phenomena.</li>
            <li><strong>Right Concentration (Sammā-Samādhi):</strong> Cultivating deep concentration through meditation, leading to insight and calm.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h2>The Three Marks of Existence</h2>
      <p>Theravada Buddhism emphasizes understanding the Three Marks of Existence as essential to spiritual insight:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Impermanence (Anicca):</strong> All things, whether physical or mental, are constantly changing and do not last forever.</li>
        <li><strong>Suffering (Dukkha):</strong> Life in samsara is inherently unsatisfactory because of its fleeting and imperfect nature.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Self (Anatta):</strong> There is no permanent, unchanging self or soul. What we perceive as the "self" is merely a collection of ever-changing components.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h2>Dependent Origination (Paticca-Samuppāda)</h2>
      <p>This doctrine explains the process by which suffering arises and ceases. It is a chain of twelve interconnected links, illustrating how ignorance leads to rebirth and suffering. By understanding and breaking this cycle, one can achieve enlightenment and liberation from samsara.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h2>The Five Precepts (Pañcasīla)</h2>
      <p>The Five Precepts are ethical guidelines that all lay Buddhists are encouraged to follow. They help cultivate a moral life and reduce harm to oneself and others:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Refrain from killing any living being.</li>
        <li>Refrain from stealing.</li>
        <li>Refrain from sexual misconduct.</li>
        <li>Refrain from false speech.</li>
        <li>Refrain from intoxicants that cloud the mind.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h2>Meditation Practices</h2>
      <p>Meditation is central to Theravada practice, aimed at cultivating mindfulness, concentration, and insight. Two primary types of meditation are practiced:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Samatha (Calm Meditation):</strong> Focuses on developing concentration and tranquility, often through breath awareness.</li>
        <li><strong>Vipassana (Insight Meditation):</strong> Involves observing the true nature of reality, seeing impermanence, suffering, and non-self. This practice leads to wisdom and liberation from rebirth.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h2>Karma and Rebirth</h2>
      <p>In Theravada Buddhism, karma refers to intentional actions that generate consequences in this life and future lives. Good deeds lead to positive karma and favorable rebirths, while unwholesome actions result in negative karma and suffering. The ultimate goal is to break free from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (samsara) by attaining Nibbana.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h2>Monastic Life and the Sangha</h2>
      <p>The monastic community (Sangha) is integral to the Theravada tradition. Monks and nuns dedicate their lives to the practice of the Buddha's teachings, relying on the lay community for material support. In return, they offer spiritual guidance and serve as exemplars of the path to enlightenment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">
      <h2>The Role of Lay Practitioners</h2>
      <p>Lay Buddhists play a crucial role in supporting the monastic community and engaging in their own spiritual practice. They observe the Five Precepts, give alms to the Sangha, and participate in temple ceremonies. Through generosity (dana), ethical living (sila), and the cultivation of wisdom (paññā), lay followers aim to progress on the path to Nibbana.</p>
